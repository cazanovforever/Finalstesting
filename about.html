                    <p>Welcome to my fine work as you can see there is plenty of conecpt art unused for work.</p>
                    <p>As i will show you I Carl will proudly pronounce you my grand plan</p>
					<p>The grand plan is to make a large rpg game with varying elements. it will be a simple pixel rpg with graphics although simple pixels can make it vibrant and big.</p>
					<p>In this game you'll be creating a random character with adjustable stats and each thing you do will have consequences</p>

                    <h2>Company History</h2>
                    <p>Well it is a solo ish kind of company if you can even count it as such. But i accept anyone willing to work into the project out of their passion. If they feel like it </p>
                    <p>If i could pay the artists i would but right now i would use my connections and befriending them. and besides they can make art if they want not like i want to force them to unless i commission them. but alas i need budget lol</p>
